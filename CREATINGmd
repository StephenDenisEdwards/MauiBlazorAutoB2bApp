## Tingler Application 

https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationMenuBlade/~/Authentication/appId/44d84416-03ea-4c42-8e3a-75a5a4439e5b/isMSAApp~/false

You're looking at the authentication settings for your **Tingler Application** in the **Microsoft Entra admin center**, specifically the redirect URIs section. These URIs determine where authentication responses (tokens) are sent after a successful login. 

### Key Points:
- **MSAL URI (`msal44d84416-03ea-4c42-8e3a-75a5a4439e5b://auth`)**: This is a custom scheme used for mobile authentication with MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Library).
- **B2C Native Client URI (`https://tinglercustomers.b2clogin.com/oauth2/nativeclient`)**: Typically used for applications integrating with Microsoft Entra External ID (B2C) for handling authentication natively.
- **Adding a URI**: You can define additional redirect URIs depending on your application's authentication flow needs.

### Next Steps:
- If you need to support **additional authentication flows**, ensure the required URI is correctly added.
- If encountering authentication errors, double-check that the redirect URIs match exactly with what’s configured in your application.
